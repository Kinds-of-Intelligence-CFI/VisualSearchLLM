Looking at the spheres in the image, most appear to be lit from the upper right direction, creating highlights on their upper right sides. However, there is one sphere in the lower left quadrant (Cell 2,1) that appears to have its highlight on the opposite side (lower left), indicating it is lit from a different direction than all the other spheres."

The sphere that appears to be lit from the opposite direction (showing a darker side where others show a lighter side) is located in the bottom left cell of the grid."
image_4996.png,17,30,0,"(2, 1)","(2, 1)",True,"Cell (2,1)

Looking at the spheres in the image, most appear to be lit from above, creating highlights at the top of each sphere and shadows at the bottom. However, there is one sphere in the lower left quadrant (Cell 2,1) that appears to have the opposite lighting pattern, with the highlight at the bottom and shadow at the top."
image_4997.png,9,30,0,"(2, 1)","(2, 2)",False,"Cell (2,1)

Looking at the spheres in the image, most appear to be lit from the upper right direction, creating highlights in that area. However, there is one sphere in the lower left quadrant (Cell 2,1) that appears to have its highlight on the opposite side, suggesting it is lit from a different direction than all the other spheres."
image_4998.png,1,30,0,"(1, 1)","(1, 1)",True,"Cell (1,1)

The sphere in the top left cell appears to be lit from a different direction compared to the other sphere in the image, with its highlight appearing on the opposite side."
